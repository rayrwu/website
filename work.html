Today, we are exposed to more temptations than ever before. Products are engineered 
to maximize company revenue even at the expense of consumers. 
Excessive consumption can pose significant harms to individuals, families, and society. <br><br>

My research examines higher-order cognitions, including decision-making, cognitive control,
and emotions in humans. For example, how do people interact with digital technology and what basic human processes can doing so reveal? <br><br>

To this end, I adopt a strong quantitative stance. I utilize 1) advanded statistical modelling (but also simpler analyses), and 
2) multi-method designs, such as by incorporating laboratory experiments with intensive longitudinal suveys.

My research training is funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.
