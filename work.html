Today, we're exposed to more temptations than ever before. Fueled by digital technology, products
 are designed to maximize consumer engagement with little to no accountability for the potential harms they may
 cause to individuals, families, or society. <br><br>

 My research interests are on higher-order cognitions, such as decision-making, emotions, and 
 cognitive control, that underly hedonic consumption. Broadly, I'm interested in how and why people interact 
 with digital technology and what these interactions reveal about
 fundamental cognitive processes in humans. In particular, my PhD focuses on modern gambling products.
 
 <br><br>

 To this end, I adopt a strong quantitative approach that rely on
 on human data. My research employs i. advanded statistical modelling (alongside simpler analyses) and 
ii. a multi-method approach, integrating laboratory experiments with intensive longitudinal surveys.
<br><br>
My PhD research training is funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada
and the Centre for Gambling Research at UBC.
