Nowadays, we are exposed to more temptations than ever before. Championed by digital technology, products are 
engineered to maximize company revenue even at the expense of consumers. Excessive consumption can pose 
significant harms to individuals, families, and society. <br><br>

 My research examines higher-order cognitions that are involved in hedonic consumption, incuding 
 decision-making processes, emotions, and cognitive control. Broadly, how do people interact with digital technology and what basic human processes does doing so reveal?
 <br><br>

 To this end, I adopt a strong quantitative approach
  and rely on human data. I utilize i. advanded statistical modelling (but also simpler analyses), and 
ii. multi-method designs, such as by incorporating laboratory experiments with intensive longitudinal suveys.

My research training is funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.
