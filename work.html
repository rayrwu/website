Today, we're exposed to more temptations than ever before. Fueled by digital technology, products
 are designed to maximize consumer engagement with little to no accountability for the potential harms they may
 cause to individuals, families, or society. <br><br>

 My research explores higher-order cognitions underlying hedonic consumption, including 
 decision-making, emotions, and cognitive control. Broadly, I investigate how and why people interact 
 with digital technology and what these interactions reveal about
 fundamental cognitive processes in humans.
 
 <br><br>

 To this end, I adopt a rigorous quantitative approach, relying 
 on human data. My research employs i. advanded statistical modelling (alongside simpler analyses) and 
ii. multi-method research designs, integrating laboratory experiments with intensive longitudinal surveys.
<br><br>
My research training is funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.
