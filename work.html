Nowadays, we're exposed to more temptations than ever before. Championed by digital technology, products are 
engineered to maximize company revenue even if excessive consumption can pose
significant harms to individuals, families, and society. <br><br>

 My research examines higher-order cognitions involved in hedonic consumption, incuding 
 decision-making processes, emotions, and cognitive control. Broadly, I'm interested in
 how people interact with digital technology and the basic processes that these interactions reveal.
 <br><br>

 To this end, I take a strong quantitative approach
  and rely on human data. I utilize i. advanded statistical modelling (but also simpler analyses), and 
ii. multi-method designs, such as by incorporating laboratory experiments with intensive longitudinal suveys.

My research training is funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.
