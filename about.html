My goal is to advance our understanding of human behavior, 
especially in the context of consuming addictive (digital) products, and to inform evidence-based policies.

<span id = "intro2_head">Research Ethos &#128147</span><br>
My work is rooted in rigour and transparency. This includes open science practices,
 having made our research and data 
 <a href= "https://www.osf.io/anm2z" target="_blank" rel = "noreferrer noopener" 
class = "aboutlink">publicly available</a>, many of which are preregistered. <br> <br><br>

<span id = "intro2_head">Working Together &#129309</span><br>
One of my favorite parts of work is collaborating
 with other people, especially in environments that 
foster challenge and creativity as well as safety and inclusion.

  and (trying to) relax with video games.
