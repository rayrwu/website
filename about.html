Hi, I'm Ray!<br><br>
I'm a cogntive scientist, an NSERC doctoral fellow, and a member of the 
Centre for Gambling Research at UBC Vancouver (who came from Toronto). <br><br>


 My research interests are on higher-order cognitions, such as decision-making and emotions, and interactions between people
and digital technology. My PhD focuses on modern gambling products.
<br><br>

To this end, my research adopts a quantiative perspective and employs a multi-method approach, integrating laboratory experiments with 
intensive longitudinal surveys. <br><br>

My research ethos is rooted in rigour and transparency. I value and exercise healthy research practices. This includes adopting
open science practices, such as preregistration and making
 our data publicy available.<br><br>

One of my favourite parts of work is collaborating with other people. I enjoy working in and strive to create
environments that foster challenge and creativity as well as 
safety and inclusion. <br><br>

Thanks for visiting and feel free to reach out! ðŸ˜Š
