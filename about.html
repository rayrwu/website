I'm Ray, an NSERC doctoral fellow and a member of the Centre for Gambling Research
at UBC Vancouver. <br><br>

I enjoy integrating perspectives from different fields to understand the impact
of digital technology on people. Working with 
 <a class = "newlink hover" href = "https://cgr.psych.ubc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke Clark</a>
, my PhD focuses on modern gambling products.<br><br>

To this end, my work is quantitative in nature. Though, it does
adopt a multi-method approach, integrating laboratory experiments with 
intensive longitudinal surveys. It also focuses on how
cognitions change <em>over time.</em>
