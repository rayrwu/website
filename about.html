Hi, I'm Ray!<br><br>
I'm a cogntive scientist (well, a PhD student), an NSERC doctoral fellow, and a member of the 
Centre for Gambling Research at UBC Vancouver. I'm originally from Toronto. <br><br>

My work is rooted in transparency and rigour. This includes open science practices, having made our
 research and data are publicly available, many of which are also preregistered. <br><br>

One of the best parts of research is collaborating with others. I strive to create
environments that foster challenge and creativity as well as 
safety and inclusion.
