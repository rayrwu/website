Hi, I'm Ray!<br><br>
I'm a cogntive scientist, an NSERC doctoral fellow, and a member of the 
Centre for Gambling Research at UBC Vancouver - Originally from Toronto. <br><br>

My research is rooted in rigour and transparency. This includes open science practices, having made our
research and data publicly available, many of which are preregistered. <br><br>

One of the best parts of work is collaborating with others. I thus strive to create
environments that foster challenge and creativity as well as 
safety and inclusion. <br><br>

Many thanks for visiting! :)
