I grew up in Toronto (Scarborough district). In my youth, I was not sure if I would make it to, and then through,
undergrad, let alone envisioning becoming an "academic" or a "scientist".
But, my longing continued to grow and this prospect slowly became more and more conceivable.

I am passionate about the craft and rigour at each stage of the research process, from conceptualization
to analysis & writing to public outreach. My goal is to advance our
knowledge of human behavior, reduce harms associataed with digital technology
use, and inform evidence-based policies. <br><br>

<span id = "intro2_head">RESEARCH ETHOS </span><br>
My work is rooted in transparency. This includes open science practices, having made all my 
articles and data publicy available (<a href= "https://www.osf.io/anm2z" target="_blank" rel = "noreferrer noopener" 
class = "aboutlink">here</a>). My graduate school application
materials are also shared (<a href= "gradmats" target="_blank" rel = "noreferrer noopener" 
class = "aboutlink">PDF</a>) in hopes that it will be helpful for prospective graduate students.<br><br>
</span>

<span id = "intro2_head">WORKING TOGETHER</span><br>
One of my favorite part of work is collaborating with people, 
especially in environments that foster 
 challenge and creativitiy as well as safety and inclusivity, whether it's for
 research, teaching, or public outreach. If anything catches your attention,
 feel free to reach out :)

Along with research, I like to play sports, explore tasty foods, and relax with video games.
