Hi, I'm Ray!<br><br>
I'm a cogntive scientist, an NSERC doctoral fellow, and a member of the 
Centre for Gambling Research at UBC Vancouver. <br><br>


 My research interests are on higher-order cognitions, such as decision-making and emotions, and interactions between people
and digital technology. My PhD focuses on modern gambling products.
<br><br>

To this end, I adopt a quantiative perspective and employ a multi-method approach, integrating laboratory experiments with 
intensive longitudinal surveys. <br><br>

My goal is to produce work that is rigorous, transparent, and (hopefully) innovative. This includes incoporating
 open science practices such as preregistration and making data and code publicly available.<br><br>

Thanks for visiting and feel free to reach out! 😊
